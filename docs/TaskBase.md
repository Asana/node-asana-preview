**completed** | **Boolean** | True if the task is currently marked complete, false if not. | [optional]

**dueOn** | **Date** | The localized date on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due date. This takes a date with &#x60;YYYY-MM-DD&#x60; format and should not be used together with &#x60;due_at&#x60;. | [optional]
